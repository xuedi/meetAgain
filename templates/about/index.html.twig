            <p class="mb-5">
                A quick Google search for a Chinese language and culture meetup in Berlin came up with 0 results when I
                first moved to this city, so I thought, why not start my own?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                Inevitably, I made a friend at a bar -- a sure-thing to happen in Berlin. Xuedi is German (even though
                he will convince you that he's Chinese) and has lived in China for 7 years...and several beers later,
                our meetup group was born!
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                The idea of this group is to bring people together and share our interests in China/Germany (or
                anywhere), speak/learn Chinese/German (or your language), make new friends, eat out, or just hang. Our
                group has been running on a fortnightly basis since 2015!
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
                Learning Chinese/German? Come practice and find tandem partners! Already speak it fluently? Come and
                hang out with us!
            </p>
