Our Wednesday meetup is open to everyone. It is the foundation of the community. We come together to discuss the latest news and developments of the International Weiqi developments. We play and analyse games.

We have our own room at the Spreeblick Cafe until the late evening, it is most easy to arrive via subway.

If you have your own weiqi board and stones, feel free to bring them to the meetup. We also have 6 sets of weiqi boards and stones for you to play with.
