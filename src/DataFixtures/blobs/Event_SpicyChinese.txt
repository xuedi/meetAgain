As suggested by Lydia in last night's Meetup, we will go eat Sichuan!

The restaurant is called Grand Tang. This is their YELP page if anyone wants to check it out (think they got the address wrong, as another restaurant also has this address on it)

I haven't been there before, but other members have came back with ever-lasting memories, and I guess that says something...

See you there!
不见不散 见了就吃。。。
