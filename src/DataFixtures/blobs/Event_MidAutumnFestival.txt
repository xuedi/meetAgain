Dear dragons,

This will be our first Mid-Autumn Festival! A festival of:

- thanksgiving
- praying to the moon goddess Chang'e and the jade rabbit
- lanterns
- matchmaking (in some places in China)
- eating mooncakes!
- and of course, watching the moon

Whatever it is, it is sure to be a night filled with magic! So join us!

We could go to the Garden der Welt, there are some events as part of the Chinese cultural festival happening there. (dragon dances, mooncakes and lanterns)....though I'm not sure if we'll be allowed to bring our own alcohol...(never been to the garden). But if anyone has some other suggestions, feel free to post below.
