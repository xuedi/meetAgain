It's perhaps slightly exagerating that Chinese will become the next world language. But is it a good investment to learn Chinese as China is perhaps on its way (some think it already is) to becoming the next world power house after America?

Yes it is!

Are you fascinated by China and are thinking about learning Chinese but have absolutely no clue where to start?

Are you learning Chinese already and would like to make new friends and share more stories and experiences about China?

还是你从国内来柏林留学，想在这里交新朋友?

No matter what the reason is, come check out our meet up!

Because let's face it, China is an awesome place, and the language...1.4 billion people does it, how hard can it be? :)
