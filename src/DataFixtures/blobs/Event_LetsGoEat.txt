It's summer and warm so let's go eat Chinese food!

Randomly passed by a place in Prenzlauer Berg called 老乡 (Laoxiang). The name immediately grabbed me as the word 老乡, which literally translates to 'fellow villager' carries with it a longing feeling and a sense of belonging that speaks to the heart of a former Chinese northerner, and a foreigner living in Germany like myself. Hmm...seems like people's heart don't change, at least NOT when it comes to eating food! Google and Yelp both gave very favorable reviews as well as word of mouth (from actual Chinese people!). The pictures look great too, you can check them out yourselves...It is a little on the pricier side, being in Prenzlauer Berg, but my gut feeling is that the wallet will be satisfied by the tongue. http://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-xiang-berlin

See you there!
