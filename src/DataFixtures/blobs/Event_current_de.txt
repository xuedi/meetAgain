Hey fellow Dragons! DE

++++++++ Interested in Chinese/German? ++++++++

Learning Chinese/German and need to practice or find language-tandem partners?

Interested in cultural exchange?

Want to meet awesome internationals?

…Or just want to get tips on where to find good Chinese food in Berlin?

Whatever the reason, come join us! The more the merrier: such is the Chinese way!

++++++++++++++++ Our meetup structure ++++++++++++++++

Our meetup is relatively unstructured. Groups often form organically and evolve and move throughout the evening consisting of members learning Chinese/German, members who are fluent/native, and the rest who are here to socialize in whatever language they’re comfortable with and jumping into whichever conversation they find themselves in.

We try our best to fulfil everyone’s expectations so we can all benefit from the meetup and have a good time; if you have any suggestions or ideas (such as outings!) please don’t hesitate to let us know! 🙂

+++ No time on Thursday’s? +++

We meet every second Thursday, but we sometimes have other events, which are not regular and occur on different days/at different locations. Stay tuned for announcements!

Looking forward to seeing old friends and making new ones 🙂

Cheers & 回头见
