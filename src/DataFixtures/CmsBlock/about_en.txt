We are a group of passionate weiqi enthusiasts who come together to share our love for this ancient and fascinating game. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of weiqi, an experienced player wanting to share strategies and improve your gameplay, or simply someone interested in joining our friendly community, you'll find a warm welcome here.

Our regular meeting times are on Wednesdays at 6pm, where we gather to play, learn, and enjoy each other's company. Beyond our weekly meetings, we organize various social events like group dinners and occasionally travel together to participate in international tournaments, fostering both our skills and friendships.
